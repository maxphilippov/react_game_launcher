Let's design a hypothetical game launcher

You can add games to your library (just random for now)

Every game comes to your library as just available for download.
Every game takes some time to download.
After you've downloaded it, it's available to play.
You can download only one game at the time. But you can pause any time you want and start downloading (or resume some other game)
